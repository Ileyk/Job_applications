abstract = {The recent detection of gravitational waves associated with a binary neutron star merger revives interest in interacting pulsar magnetospheres. Current models predict that a significant amount of magnetic energy should be released prior to the merger, leading to electromagnetic precursor emission. In this paper, we revisit this problem in the light of the recent progress in kinetic modeling of pulsar magnetospheres. We limit our work to the case of aligned magnetic moments and rotation axes, and thus neglect the orbital motion. We perform global two-dimensional axisymmetric particle-in-cell simulations of two pulsar magnetospheres merging at a rate consistent with the emission of gravitational waves. Both symmetric and asymmetric systems are investigated. Simulations show a significant enhancement of magnetic dissipation within the magnetospheres as both stars get closer. Even though the magnetospheric configuration depends on the relative orientations of the pulsar spins and magnetic axes, all configurations present nearly the same radiative signature, indicating that a common dissipation mechanism is at work. The relative motion of both pulsars drives magnetic reconnection at the boundary between the two magnetospheres, leading to efficient particle acceleration and high-energy synchrotron emission. Polar-cap discharge is also strongly enhanced in asymmetric configurations, resulting in vigorous pair production and potentially additional high-energy radiation. We observe an increase in the pulsar radiative efficiency by two orders of magnitude over the last orbit before the merger exceeding the spindown power of an isolated pulsar. The expected signal is too weak to be detected at high energies even in the nearby universe. However, if a small fraction of this energy is channeled into radio waves, it could be observed as a non-repeating fast radio burst.},

abstract = {The central engine of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) is hidden from direct view, operating at a scale much smaller than that probed by the emitted radiation. Thus we must infer its origin not only with respect to the formation of the {\{}$\backslash$it trigger{\}} - the actual astrophysical configuration that is capable of powering a sGRB - but also from the consequences that follow from the various evolutionary pathways that may be involved in producing it. Considering binary neutron star mergers we critically evaluate, analytically and through numerical simulations, whether the neutrino-driven wind produced by the newly formed hyper-massive neutron star can allow the collimated relativistic outflow that follows its collapse to actually produce a sGRB or not. Upon comparison with the observed sGRB duration distribution, we find that collapse cannot be significantly delayed ({\textless}=100 ms) before the outflow is choked, thus limiting the possibility that long-lived hyper-massive remnants can account for these events. In the case of successful breakthrough of the jet through the neutrino-driven wind, the energy stored in the cocoon could contribute to the precursor and extended emission observed in sGRBs.},

@article{Webb2014,
abstract = {(Abridged) Noise considerations for experiments that aim to statistically estimate the 21 cm signal from high redshift neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) using interferometric data are typically computed assuming a tracked observation, where the telescope pointing centre and instrument phase centre are the same over the observation. Current low frequency interferometers use aperture arrays of fixed dipoles, which are steered electronically on the sky, and have different properties to mechanically-steered single apertures, such as reduced sensitivity away from zenith, and discrete pointing positions on the sky. Use of two additional observing modes is encouraged: (1) zenith drift, where the pointing centre remains fixed at the zenith, and the phase centre tracks the sky, and (2) drift+shift, where the telescope uses discrete pointing centres, and the sky drifts during each pointing. The coherence of measurements in these modes dictates the optimal reduction in thermal noise by combination of coherent modes, and the reduction in cosmic variance by combination of incoherent modes (views of different patches of the sky). The balance between these noise components provides one measure for the utility of these three modes for measuring a statistical EoR signature. We provide a general framework for estimating the uncertainty in the power spectrum for a given observing mode, telescope beam shape, and antenna distribution. We apply this framework to the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) using an analysis of the 2D and 1D power spectra for 900 hours of observing. We demonstrate that zenith drift scans can yield marginally lower uncertainty in the signal power compared with tracked scans for the MWA EoR experiment.},

abstract = {Massive stars, at least {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 10 times more massive than the Sun, have two key properties that make them the main drivers of evolution of star clusters, galaxies, and the Universe as a whole. On the one hand, the outer layers of massive stars are so hot that they produce most of the ionizing ultraviolet radiation of galaxies; in fact, the first massive stars helped to re-ionize the Universe after its Dark Ages. Another important property of massive stars are the strong stellar winds and outflows they produce. This mass loss, and finally the explosion of a massive star as a supernova or a gamma-ray burst, provide a significant input of mechanical and radiative energy into the interstellar space. These two properties together make massive stars one of the most important cosmic engines: they trigger the star formation and enrich the interstellar medium with heavy elements, that ultimately leads to formation of Earth-like rocky planets and the development of complex life. The study of massive star winds is thus a truly multidisciplinary field and has a wide impact on different areas of astronomy. [...] This detailed review summarises the current knowledge on the theory and observations of winds from massive stars, as well as on observations and accretion processes in wind-fed high mass X-ray binaries. The aim is to combine in the near future all available theoretical diagnostics and observational measurements to achieve a unified picture of massive star winds in isolated objects and in binary systems.},

abstract = {Magnetospheres of many astrophysical objects can be accurately described by the low-inertia (or ``force-free'') limit of MHD. We present a new numerical method for the solution of equations of force-free relativistic MHD based on the finite-difference time-domain approach, with a prescription for handling the spontaneous formation of current sheets. We use this method to study the time-dependent evolution of pulsar magnetospheres in both aligned and oblique magnetic geometries. For the aligned rotator, we confirm the general properties of the time-independent solution of Contopoulos et al. For the oblique rotator, we present the three-dimensional structure of the magnetosphere and compute, for the first time, the spin-down power of pulsars as a function of the inclination of the magnetic axis. We find that the pulsar spin-down luminosity is L{\~{}}($\mu$2$\Omega$4*/c3) (1+sin2$\alpha$), where $\mu$ is the stellar dipole moment, $\Omega$* is the rotation frequency, and $\alpha$ is the magnetic inclination angle. We also discuss the effects of current sheet resistivity and reconnection on the structure and evolution of the magnetosphere.},

abstract = {We have developed a stellar wind model for OB supergiants to investigate the effects of accretion from a clumpy wind on the luminosity and variability properties of high-mass X-ray binaries. Assuming that the clumps are confined by ram pressure of the ambient gas and exploring different distributions for their mass and radii, we computed the expected X-ray light curves in the framework of the Bondi-Hoyle accretion theory, modified to take into account the presence of clumps. The resulting variability properties are found to depend not only on the assumed orbital parameters but also on the wind characteristics. We have then applied this model to reproduce the X-ray light curves of three representative high-mass X-ray binaries: two persistent supergiant systems (Vela X-1 and 4U 1700-377) and the supergiant fast X-ray transient IGR J11215-5952. The model can reproduce the observed light curves well, but requiring in all cases an overall mass loss from the supergiant about a factor of 3-10 smaller than the values inferred from ultraviolet lines studies that assume a homogeneous wind.},

abstract = {Objective To evaluate sperm DNA fragmentation in normozoospermic male partners of couples undergoing infertility evaluation. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Clinical andrology laboratory. Patient(s) A total of 1,974 consecutive normozoospermic men selected from a larger cohort of 4,345 consecutive, nonazoospermic men presenting for infertility evaluation. Intervention(s) None. Main Outcome Measure(s) Clinical parameters, conventional semen parameters, and sperm DNA fragmentation assessed by flow cytometry-based TUNEL assay and reported as percent sperm DNA fragmentation ({\%}SDF). Result(s) The mean (±SD) {\%}SDF and the proportion of men with high {\%}SDF ({\textgreater}30{\%}) were significantly lower in the normozoospermic compared with the entire cohort of 4,345 evaluable infertile men (17.6{\%} ± 10.1{\%} vs. 20.7{\%} ± 12.4{\%} and 11{\%} vs. 20{\%}, respectively). In the group of 1,974 normozoospermic men, {\%}SDF was positively correlated with paternal age (r = 0.17) and inversely correlated with progressive motility (r = -0.26). In the subset of normozoospermic men with sperm parameters above the 50th percentile (≥73 × 106sperm/mL, ≥55{\%} progressive motility, and ≥14{\%} normal forms, World Health Organization 2010 guidelines), 5{\%} (4 of 83) had elevated {\%}SDF ({\textgreater}30{\%}). Conclusion(s) In this large cohort of normozoospermic men presenting for infertility evaluation, DNA fragmentation level is related to sperm motility and paternal age, and 11{\%} of these men have high levels of sperm DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, the data indicate that a nonnegligible proportion (5{\%}) of normozoospermic men with high-normal sperm parameters may also have significant sperm DNA fragmentation.

abstract = {Recent observations of long and short gamma-ray bursts have revealed a puzzling X-ray activity that in some cases continues for hours after the burst. It is difficult to reconcile such time-scales with the viscous time-scales that an accretion disc can plausibly provide. Here I discuss the accretion activity expected from the material that is launched into eccentric but gravitationally bound orbits during a compact binary merger coalescence. From a simple analytical model the time-scales and accretion luminosities that result from fallback in the aftermath of a compact binary merger are derived. For the considered mass range, double neutron star binaries are relatively homogeneous in their fallback luminosities. Neutron star black hole systems show a larger spread in their fallback behaviour. While the model is too simple to make predictions about the detailed time structure of the fallback, it makes reasonable predictions about the gross properties of the fallback. About one hour after the coalescence the fallback accretion luminosity can still be as large as {\~{}}1045erg s-1, a fraction of which will be transformed into X-rays. Large-scale amplitude variations in the X-ray luminosities can plausibly be caused by gravitational fragmentation, which for the high-eccentricity fallback should occur more easily than in an accretion disc.},

The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per {\$}8.0\backslashtimes10{\^{}}4{\$} years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 to 1.60 {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, with the total mass of the system {\$}2.74{\^{}}{\{}+0.04{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.01{\}}\backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}.

The association with the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation and cosmology.},

abstract = {We present first-principles relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of the oblique pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. The magnetosphere starts to form with particles extracted from the surface of the neutron star. These particles are accelerated by surface electric fields and emit photons capable of producing electron-positron pairs. We inject secondary pairs at locations of primary energetic particles, whose energy exceeds the threshold for pair formation. We find solutions that are close to the ideal force-free magnetosphere, with the Y-point and current sheet. Solutions with obliquities {\$}\backslashlt 40{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$} do not show pair production in the open field line region, because the local current density along magnetic field is below the Goldreich-Julian value. The bulk outflow in these solutions is charge separated, and pair formation happens in the current sheet and return current layer only. Solutions with higher inclinations show pair production in the open field line region, with high multiplicity of the bulk flow and the size of pair-producing region increasing with inclination. We observe the spin-down of the star to be comparable to MHD model predictions. The magnetic dissipation in the current sheet ranges between 20{\%} for the aligned rotator and 3{\%} for the orthogonal rotator. Our results suggest that for low obliquity neutron stars with suppressed pair formation at the light cylinder, the presence of phenomena related to pair activity in the bulk of the polar region, e.g., radio emission, may crucially depend on the physics beyond our simplified model, such as the effects of curved space-time or multipolar surface fields.},

abstract = {We present a new code, Lorene's Ghost (for Lorene's gravitational handling of spectral transport) developed to treat the problem of neutrino transport in supernovae with the use of spectral methods. First, we derive the expression for the nonrelativistic Liouville operator in doubly spherical coordinates (r, theta, phi, epsilon, Theta, Phi){\$}, and further its general relativistic counterpart. We use the 3 + 1 formalism with the conformally flat approximation for the spatial metric, to express the Liouville operator in the Eulerian frame. Our formulation does not use any approximations when dealing with the angular arguments (theta, phi, Theta, Phi), and is fully energy-dependent. This approach is implemented in a spherical shell, using either Chebyshev polynomials or Fourier series as decomposition bases. It is here restricted to simplified collision terms (isoenergetic scattering) and to the case of a static fluid. We finish this paper by presenting test results using basic configurations, including general relativistic ones in the Schwarzschild metric, in order to demonstrate the convergence properties, the conservation of particle number and correct treatment of some general-relativistic effects of our code. The use of spectral methods enables to run our test cases in a six-dimensional setting on a single processor.},

abstract = {The solutions of the two-dimensional hydromagnetic equations are used to calculate the torque on a magnetic neutron star accreting from a Keplerian disk. It is found that the magnetic coupling between the star and the plasma in the outer transition zone is appreciable; that as a result, the spin-up torque on fast rotators is substantially less than that on slow rotators, and that for sufficiently high stellar angular velocities or sufficiently low mass accretion rates, the rotation of the star can be braked while accretion continues. These results are applied to pulsating X-ray sources, revealing that at high luminosities a star of given spin period rotating in the same direction as the disk can experience either spin-up or spin-down, depending on its luminosity. Also considered are the general problem of interpreting period changes in pulsating X-ray sources, and the dipole magnetic moments of nine pulsating X-ray sources are estimated by fitting the theoretical spin-up equation to estimates of the average luminosity and spin-up rate of each source.},

We develop a generic dynamic model for the merger ejecta, where the transition from sub-relativistic to relativistic is well described. We show that the ejecta emission (the "merger-nova") powered by the magnetar can have an optical peak brightness comparable to a supernova, which is a few tens or hundreds times brighter than the radioactive-powered merger-novae (the so-called macro-nova or kilo-nova). However, the duration of the magnetar-powered merger-nova peaks earlier and has a duration significantly shorter than that of a supernova. An X-ray bump appears even earlier in time. Such merger-novae may be detected with NS-NS merger events with or without a short gamma-ray burst, and could be a bright electromagnetic counterpart for gravitational wave bursts due to NS-NS mergers. If detected, it suggests that the merger leaves behind a massive NS, which has important implications in understanding the equation-of-state of nuclear matter.},

abstract = {The tidal effects created by the presence of a compact companion are expected to induce a stream of enhanced wind from the early-type primary star in massive X-ray binary systems. In this paper, two-dimensional gasdynamical simulations of such streams are presented. It is found that the wind enhancement is a sensitive function of the binary separation, and develops into a tidal stream as the primary approaches its critical surface. For typical system parameters, the Coriolis force deflects the stream sufficiently that it does not impact directly on the compact companion but passes behind it. The density in the stream can reach values of 20-30 times the ambient wind density, leading to strong attenuation of the X-ray flux that passes through the tidal stream, providing a possible explanation of the enhanced absorption events seen at later phases in the X-ray observations of massive X-ray binary systems such as Vela X-1. In contrast to the time-variable accretion wake, the tidal stream is relatively stationary, producing absorption features that should remain fixed from orbit to orbit. For systems with a strong tidal stream, the large asymmetry in the accreting wind results in the accretion of angular momentum of constant sign, as opposed to systems without streams, where the sign of the accreted angular momentum can change.},

abstract = {Determining the final result of black hole-neutron star mergers, and in particular the amount of matter remaining outside the black hole at late times and its properties, has been one of the main motivations behind the numerical simulation of these systems. Black hole-neutron star binaries are amongst the most likely progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts --- as long as massive (probably a few percents of a solar mass), hot accretion disks are formed around the black hole. Whether this actually happens strongly depends on the physical characteristics of the system, and in particular on the mass ratio, the spin of the black hole, and the radius of the neutron star. We present here a simple two-parameter model, fitted to existing numerical results, for the determination of the mass remaining outside the black hole a few milliseconds after a black hole-neutron star merger (i.e. the combined mass of the accretion disk, the tidal tail, and the potential ejecta). This model predicts the remnant mass within a few percents of the mass of the neutron star, at least for remnant masses up to 20{\%} of the neutron star mass. Results across the range of parameters deemed to be the most likely astrophysically are presented here. We find that, for 10 solar mass black holes, massive disks are only possible for large neutron stars (R{\textgreater}12km), or quasi-extremal black hole spins (a/M{\textgreater}0.9). We also use our model to discuss how the equation of state of the neutron star affects the final remnant, and the strong influence that this can have on the rate of short gamma-ray bursts produced by black hole-neutron star mergers.},

abstract = {The most promising astrophysical sources of kHz gravitational waves (GWs) are the inspiral and merger of binary neutron star(NS)/black hole systems. Maximizing the scientific return of a GW detection will require identifying a coincident electro-magnetic (EM) counterpart. One of the most likely sources of isotropic EM emission from compact object mergers is a supernova-like transient powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in ejecta from the merger. We present the first calculations of the optical transients from compact object mergers that self-consistently determine the radioactive heating by means of a nuclear reaction network; using this heating rate, we model the light curve with a one dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculation. For an ejecta mass {\~{}}1e-2 M{\_}sun[1e-3 M{\_}sun] the resulting light curve peaks on a timescale {\~{}} 1 day at a V-band luminosity nu L{\_}nu {\~{}} 3e41[1e41] ergs/s (M{\_}V = -15[-14]); this corresponds to an effective "f" parameter {\~{}}3e-6 in the Li-Paczynski toy model. We argue that these results are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in the relevant nuclear physics and to the precise early-time dynamics and ejecta composition. Due to the rapid evolution and low luminosity of NS merger transients, EM counterpart searches triggered by GW detections will require close collaboration between the GW and astronomical communities. NS merger transients may also be detectable following a short-duration Gamma-Ray Burst or "blindly" with present or upcoming optical transient surveys. Because the emission produced by NS merger ejecta is powered by the formation of rare r-process elements, current optical transient surveys can directly constrain the unknown origin of the heaviest elements in the Universe.},

abstract = {Direct detection of black hole-neutron star pairs is anticipated with the advent of aLIGO. Electromagnetic counterparts may be crucial for a confident gravitational-wave detection as well as for extraction of astronomical information. Yet black hole-neutron star pairs are notoriously dark and so inaccessible to telescopes. Contrary to this expectation, a bright electromagnetic transient can occur in the final moments before merger as long as the neutron star is highly magnetized. The orbital motion of the neutron star magnet creates a Faraday flux and corresponding power available for luminosity. A spectrum of curvature radiation ramps up until the rapid injection of energy ignites a fireball, which would appear as an energetic blackbody peaking in the x ray to $\gamma$ rays for neutron star field strengths ranging from 10 12 G to 10 16 G respectively and a 10M black hole. The fireball event may last from a few milliseconds to a few seconds depending on the neutron star magnetic-field strength, and may be observable with the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor with a rate up to a few per year for neutron star field strengths 10 14 G. We also discuss a possible decaying post-merger event which could accompany this signal. As an electromagnetic counterpart to these otherwise dark pairs, the black-hole battery should be of great value to the development of multi-messenger astronomy in the era of aLIGO.},

The force is related to the solution of the line-transfer problem, and it becomes a function of the local velocity gradient. A new stellar wind theory, with a different interpretation of the singular point, is developed to treat this situation. The rate of mass loss, and other properties of the model, are uniquely specified by the luminosity, mass, and radius of the star. Alternative static models do not exist. Numerical results give a rate of mass loss equal to .000006 solar mass per year for an O5 star, with a terminal velocity of 1500 km/sec.

The early afterglow fades rapidly with alpha{\textless}-2.6 at t{\~{}}8-32 hr post-burst and has a spectral index of beta=-1.5 (F{\_}nu t{\^{}}alpha*nu{\^{}}beta), leading to an expected near-IR brightness at the time of the first HST observation of m(F160W){\textgreater}29.3 AB mag.

The upper limit in the HST optical observations is m(F606W){\textgreater}27.7 AB mag (3-sigma), indicating an unusually red color of V-H{\textgreater}1.9 mag. Comparing the observed near-IR luminosity to theoretical models of kilonovae produced by ejecta from the merger of an NS-NS or NS-BH binary, we infer an ejecta mass of M{\_}ej{\~{}}0.03-0.08 Msun for v{\_}ej=0.1-0.3c. The inferred mass matches the expectations from numerical merger simulations. The presence of a kilonova provides the strongest evidence to date that short GRBs are produced by compact object mergers, and provides initial insight on the ejected mass and the primary role that compact object merger may play in the r-process. Equally important, it demonstrates that gravitational wave sources detected by Advanced LIGO/Virgo will be accompanied by optical/near-IR counterparts with unusually red colors, detectable by existing and upcoming large wide-field facilities (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DECam, Subaru, LSST).},

abstract = {The mergers of double neutron star (NS-NS) and black hole (BH)-NS binaries are promising gravitational wave (GW) sources for Advanced LIGO and future GW detectors. The neutron-rich ejecta from such merger events undergoes rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, enriching our Galaxy with rare heavy elements like gold and platinum. The radioactive decay of these unstable nuclei also powers a rapidly evolving, supernova-like transient known as a "kilonova". Kilonovae provide an approximately isotropic electromagnetic counterpart to the GW signal, which also provides a unique and direct probe of an important, if not dominant, r-process site. This handbook reviews the history and physics of kilonovae, leading to the current paradigm of week-long emission with a spectral peak at near-infrared wavelengths. Using a simple light curve model to illustrate the basic physics, I introduce potentially important variations on this canonical picture, including: {\~{}}day-long optical ("blue") emission from lanthanide-free components of the ejecta; {\~{}}hours-long precursor UV/blue emission, powered by the decay of free neutrons in the outermost ejecta layers; and enhanced emission due to energy input from a long-lived central engine, such as an accreting BH or millisecond magnetar. I assess the prospects of detecting kilonovae following future GW detections of NS-NS/BH-NS mergers in light of the recent follow-up campaign of the LIGO binary BH-BH mergers.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of a faint gamma-ray burst (GRB) coincident with the gravitational wave (GW) event GW 170817 revealed the existence of a population of low-luminosity short duration gamma-ray transients produced by neutron star mergers in the nearby Universe. These events could be routinely detected by existing gamma-ray monitors, yet previous observations failed to identify them without the aid of GW triggers. Here we show that GRB150101B was an analogue of GRB170817A located at a cosmological distance. GRB 150101B was a faint short duration GRB characterized by a bright optical counterpart and a long-lived X-ray afterglow. These properties are unusual for standard short GRBs and are instead consistent with an explosion viewed off-axis: the optical light is produced by a luminous kilonova component, while the observed X-rays trace the GRB afterglow viewed at an angle of {\~{}}13 degrees. Our findings suggest that these properties could be common among future electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources.},

abstract = {We review current understanding of kilonova/macronova emission from compact binary mergers (mergers of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole). Kilonova/macronova is optical and near-infrared emission powered by radioactive decays of r-process nuclei. Emission from the dynamical ejecta with {\~{}}0.01 Msun is likely to have a luminosity of {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}40{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}41{\}} erg s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} with a characteristic timescale of about 1 week. The spectral peak is located in red optical or near-infrared wavelengths. A subsequent accretion disk wind may provide an additional luminosity, or an earlier/bluer emission if it is not absorbed by the precedent dynamical ejecta. The detection of near-infrared excess in the afterglow of short GRB 130603B and possible optical excess in GRB 060614 supports the concept of the kilonova/macronova scenario. At 200 Mpc distance, a typical brightness of kilonova/macronova with 0.01 Msun ejecta is expected to be about 22 mag and the emission rapidly fades to {\textgreater}24 mag within {\~{}}10 days after the merger. Kilonova/macronova candidates can be distinguished from supernovae by (1) the faster time evolution, (2) fainter absolute magnitudes, and (3) redder colors. To effectively search for such objects, follow-up survey observations with multiple visits within {\textless}10 days and with multiple filters will be important. Since the high expansion velocity (v {\~{}} 0.1-0.2c) is a robust outcome of compact binary mergers, the detection of smooth spectra will be the smoking gun to conclusively identify the GW source.},

abstract = {With recent advances in gravitational-wave astronomy, the direct detection of gravitational waves from the merger of two stellar- mass compact objects has become a realistic prospect. Evolutionary scenarios towards mergers of various double compact objects generally invoke so-called common-envelope evolution, which is poorly understood and leads to large uncertainties in the predicted merger rates. Here we explore, as an alternative, the scenario of massive overcontact binary (MOB) evolution, which involves two very massive stars in a very tight binary that remain fully mixed as a result of their tidally induced high spin. While many of these systems merge early on, we find many MOBs that swap mass several times, but survive as a close binary until the stars collapse. The simplicity of the MOB scenario allows us to use the efficient public stellar-evolution code MESA to explore it systematically by means of detailed numerical calculations. We find that, at low metallicity, MOBs produce double-black-hole (BH+BH) systems that will merge within a Hubble time with mass-ratios close to one, in two mass ranges, about 25 . . . 60M? and ∼ {\textgreater} 130M?, with pair- instability supernovae (PISNe) being produced at intermediate masses. Our models are also able to reproduce counterparts of various stages in the MOB scenario in the local Universe, providing direct support for the scenario.We map the initial binary parameter space that produces BH+BH mergers, determine the expected chirp mass distribution, merger times, and expected Kerr parameters, and predict event rates.We find typically one BH+BH merger event for ∼ 1, 000 core-collapse supernovae for Z ∼ {\textless} Z?/10 . The advanced LIGO (aLIGO) detection rate is more uncertain and depends on the cosmic metallicity evolution. From deriving upper and lower limits from a local and a global approximation for the metallicity distribution of massive stars, we estimate aLIGO detection rates (at the aLIGO design limit) of ∼ 19 − 550 yr−1 for BH-BH mergers below the PISN gap and of ∼ 2.1 − 370 yr−1 above the PISN gap. Even with conservative assumptions, we find that aLIGO will probably soon detect BH+BH mergers from the MOB scenario. These could be the dominant source for aLIGO detections.},

abstract = {Strongly-magnetized, rapidly-rotating neutron stars are contenders for the central engines of both long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Models for typical ({\~{}}minute long) LGRBs invoke magnetars with high dipole magnetic fields (Bd {\textgreater} 1e15 G) and short spin-down times, while models for SLSNe-I invoke neutron stars with weaker fields and longer spin-down times of weeks. Here we identify a transition region in the space of Bd and birth period for which a magnetar can power both a long GRB and a luminous SN. In particular, we show that a 2 ms period magnetar with a spin-down time of {\~{}}1e4 s can explain the observations of both the ultra-long GRB 111209 and its associated luminous SN2011kl. For magnetars with longer spin down times, we predict even longer duration ({\~{}}1e6 s) GRBs and brighter supernovae, a correlation that extends to Swift J2058+05 (commonly interpreted as a tidal disruption event). We further show that previous estimates of the maximum rotational energy of a proto-magnetar were too conservative and energies up to Emax {\~{}}1-2e53 erg are possible. The magnetar model can therefore comfortably accommodate the extreme energy requirements recently posed by the most luminous supernova ASASSN-15lh. The high ionization flux from a pulsar wind nebula powering ASASSN-15lh may lead to an "ionization break-out" X-ray burst over the coming months, which would be accompanied by an abrupt change in the optical spectrum. We conclude by briefly contrasting millisecond magnetar and black hole models for SLSNe and ultra-long GRBs.},

Topics investigated include constraints set by PNs to the mass-loss processes in AGB stars, the initial-mass range of stars producing PNs, the composition of PNs, the transition from the AGB to the PN stage, and the evolution of central stars of PNs. It is shown that the envelope ejection must satisfy certain conditions if an observable PN is to be produced. The fact that PNs may have rather different lifetimes can have important consequences for the vital statistics of IMS. Since low-mass stars are likely to produce short-living PNs, and higher mass stars are likely to generate long-living PNs, incorrent conclusions could be derived adopting a unique nebular lifetime (about 30,000 yr) for all PNs.},

abstract = {We investigate mass transfer in binaries consisting of a mass-losing Mira variable and an accreting compact companion. Although these systems are generally assumed to interact via Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton (BHL) wind accretion, this mechanism cannot adequately explain the observations of the nearest and best-studied symbiotic binary, Mira. We propose a new mass-transfer mode, " wind Roche-Lobe Overflow " (wind RLOF), which we demonstrate with 3-D numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We show that this mode occurs when the wind acceleration zone lies close to, or is a significant fraction of, the Roche-lobe radius. The circumstellar outflows which result tend to be highly aspherical and strongly focused towards the binary orbital plane. The mass-transfer rates are also at least an order of magnitude greater than the analogous BHL values. We discuss the implications of these results for symbiotic binaries and other related systems, e.g. barium stars, bipolar planetary nebulae, and Ia supernovae. The binary Mira consists of a cool, pulsating AGB star (o Ceti) and a hot companion, generally assumed to be a white dwarf. The stars appear to be strongly interacting with detections of, for example, a hook-like extension from Mira A towards Mira B, dust clumps in the direction of Mira B, and evidence for a bipolar outflow (Karovska et al. 1997; Karitskaya et al. 2005; Marengo et al. 2001; Josselin et al. 2000). These observations pose a considerable challenge for standard mass-transfer theories: given the large binary separation, a ≈ 100 AU, the highly aspherical outflow is inconsistent with BHL wind accretion and, because the radius of Mira is at least an order of magni-tude smaller than its Roche-lobe radius (R L), the observations cannot be explained by standard RLOF. We propose a new mass-transfer mode, wind RLOF, which occurs when the wind acceleration radius, i.e. the dust formation radius (R dust) in Miras, is comparable to or larger than R L , i.e. when R dust /R L 1 (Mohamed {\&} Podsiadlowski 2007; Mohamed 2010). In this case the wind material, lifted from the AGB surface by pulsation-induced shocks, does not have sufficient velocity to escape spherically from the primary's Roche lobe, i.e. v wind (R L) {\textless} v esc (R L). Instead it flows onto the companion through the inner Lagrangian point, L 1 , as demonstrated by model M1 (Figure 1). The companion ac-cretes about half of the mass lost by the primary – much more than the typical BHL fraction of a few percent. The material which does escape forms a highly equatorial outflow traversed by spiral shocks. Dust grains condense out of the dense, cool gas be-hind these shocks, forming dusty, spiral arms and arcs that trace dust-free cavities. As R dust /R L decreases, the outflow geometry becomes more spherical though still contain-ing strong asymmetries (see model M2 in Fig. 1). Dust shells are ejected periodically 355},

abstract = {The majority of ultraluminous X-ray sources are point sources that are spatially offset from the nuclei of nearby galaxies and whose X-ray luminosities exceed the theoretical maximum for spherical infall (the Eddington limit) onto stellar-mass black holes. Their X-ray luminosities in the 0.5–10 kiloelectronvolt energy band range from 1039 to 1041 ergs per second. Because higher masses imply less extreme ratios of the luminosity to the isotropic Eddington limit, theoretical models have focused on black hole rather than neutron star systems. The most challenging sources to explain are those at the luminous end of the range (more than 1040 ergs per second), which require black hole masses of 50–100 times the solar value or significant departures from the standard thin disk accretion that powers bright Galactic X-ray binaries, or both. Here we report broadband X-ray observations of the nuclear region of the galaxy M82 that reveal pulsations with an average period of 1.37 seconds and a 2.5-day sinusoidal modulation. The pulsations result from the rotation of a magnetized neutron star, and the modulation arises from its binary orbit. The pulsed flux alone corresponds to an X-ray luminosity in the 3–30 kiloelectronvolt range of 4.9 × 1039 ergs per second. The pulsating source is spatially coincident with a variable source that can reach an X-ray luminosity in the 0.3–10 kiloelectronvolt range of 1.8 × 1040 ergs per second. This association implies a luminosity of about 100 times the Eddington limit for a 1.4-solar-mass object, or more than ten times brighter than any known accreting pulsar. This implies that neutron stars may not be rare in the ultraluminous X-ray population, and it challenges physical models for the accretion of matter onto magnetized compact objects.},

The major progress to date on understanding GRBs has been for long bursts which are typically at high redshift (z {\~{}} 1) and are in sub-luminous star-forming host galaxies. They are likely produced in core-collapse explosions of massive stars. Until the present observation, no short GRB had been accurately ({\textless}10") and rapidly (minutes) located.

abstract = {The most popular model for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) involves the coalescence of binary neutron stars. Because the progenitor is actually hidden from view, we must consider under which circumstances such merging systems are capable of producing a successful sGRB. Soon after coalescence, winds are launched from the merger remnant. In this paper, we use realistic wind profiles derived from global merger simulations in order to investigate the interaction of sGRB jets with these winds using numerical simulations. We analyze the conditions for which these axisymmetric winds permit relativistic jets to breakout and produce a sGRB. We find that jets with luminosities comparable to those observed in sGRBs are only successful when their half-opening angles are below {\~{}}20{\{}$\backslash$deg{\}}. This jet collimation mechanism leads to a simple physical interpretation of the luminosities and opening angles inferred for sGRBs. If wide, low luminosity jets are observed, they might be indicative of a different progenitor avenue such as the merger of a neutron star with a black hole. We also use the observed durations of sGRB to place constraints on the lifetime of the wind phase, which is determined by the time it takes the jet to breakout. In all cases we find that the derived limits argue against completely stable remnants for binary neutron star mergers that produce sGRBs.},

abstract = {We provide a comprehensive review of major developments in our understanding of gamma-ray bursts, with particular focus on the discoveries made within the last fifteen years when their true nature was uncovered. We describe the observational properties of photons from the radio to 100s GeV bands, both in the prompt emission and the afterglow phases. Mechanisms for the generation of these photons in GRBs are discussed and confronted with observations to shed light on the physical properties of these explosions, their progenitor stars and the surrounding medium. After presenting observational evidence that a powerful, collimated, jet moving at close to the speed of light is produced in these explosions, we describe our current understanding regarding the generation, acceleration, and dissipation of the jet. We discuss mounting observational evidence that long duration GRBs are produced when massive stars die, and that at least some short duration bursts are associated with old, roughly solar mass, compact stars. The question of whether a black-hole or a strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating neutron star is produced in these explosions is also discussed. We provide a brief summary of what we have learned about relativistic collisionless shocks and particle acceleration from GRB afterglow studies, and discuss the current understanding of radiation mechanism during the prompt emission phase. We discuss theoretical predictions of possible high-energy neutrino emission from GRBs and the current observational constraints. Finally, we discuss how these explosions may be used to study cosmology, e.g. star formation, metal enrichment, reionization history, as well as the formation of first stars and galaxies in the universe.},

This requires the effective isotropic equivalent afterglow shock energy in the visible region to increase as {\$}\backslashsim t{\^{}}{\{}1.7{\}}{\$}. The two main channels for such an energy increase are (i) $\backslash$emph{\{}radial{\}}: more energy carried by slower material (in the visible region) gradually catches up with the afterglow shock and energizes it, and (ii) $\backslash$emph{\{}angular{\}}: more energy in relativistic outflow moving at different angles to our line of sight, whose radiation is initially beamed away from us but its beaming cone gradually reaches our line of sight as it decelerates. One cannot distinguish between these explanations (or combinations of them) using only the X-ray to radio {\$}F{\_}\backslashnu(t){\$}. Here we demonstrate that the most promising way to break this degeneracy is through afterglow imaging and polarization, by calculating the predicted evolution of the afterglow image (its size, shape and flux centroid) and linear polarization {\$}\backslashPi(t){\$} for different angular and/or radial outflow structures that fit {\$}F{\_}\backslashnu(t){\$}. We consider two angular profiles -- a Gaussian and a narrow core with power-law wings in energy per solid angle, as well as a (cocoon motivated) (quasi-) spherical flow with radial velocity profile. For a jet viewed off-axis (and a magnetic field produced in the afterglow shock) {\$}\backslashPi(t){\$} peaks when the jet's core becomes visible, at {\$}\backslashapprox2t{\_}p{\$} where the lightcurve peaks at {\$}t{\_}p{\$}, and the image can be elongated with aspect ratios{\$}\backslash;\backslashgtrsim2{\$}. A quasi-spherical flow has an almost circular image and a much lower {\$}\backslashPi(t){\$} (peaking at {\$}\backslashapprox t{\_}p{\$}) and flux centroid displacement.},
