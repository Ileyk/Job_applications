Dear Sir/Madam,
\\

please find enclosed my application for the Owen Chamberlain Fellowship at  Physics Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. I am currently a 3rd year, graduate student  at Laboratoire Astroparticule and Cosmologie (APC, Universit\'e Paris 7 - Denis Diderot) in France, where since fall of 2012, I have been conducting my graduate research in observational cosmology, working under the supervision of Dr.~Radek Stompor. I am expected to receive my doctoral degree by the summer of 2015.

I have been fascinated by cosmology very early and since the beginning of my Master thesis work in the summer of 2012, I have focused my research interests on its observational aspects with specific emphasis on cosmic microwave background data sets, their analysis and scientific exploitation. In particular, I have been deeply involved in the analysis and the interpretation of the cosmological observations as conducted by one of the leading experimental efforts in the field, Berkeley-led CMB experiment {\sc{polarbear}}. This project allowed me to develop broad knowledge and numerous skills in cosmology, physics, numerical and statistical methods, which I have described together with my scientific interests in more detail in my research statement, which I enclose.

With my graduate studies coming to the end next year, I would be delighted to be able to pursue my research career at LBNL. Over the past two years, I have had an opportunity to visit Berkeley
on a few occasions and have first hand experience of how exciting scientific environment and numerous collaborative opportunities it provides. I look forward to returning there for
a longer time. The scientific environment of LBNL and Berkeley is indeed a very good match to my research program, which involves physics, cosmology as well as statistical algorithms and methods, and which, without any doubt, would benefit enormously from and, I believe, contribute to research and projects undertaken at Physics Division, Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics, but also Berkeley Institute for Data Science.

I am therefore particularly excited about the opportunity provided by the Owen Chamberlain Fellowship program to carry out the proposed research at LBNL.

I would be glad to provide you with any additional needed information.
\\

Thank you for your consideration.
