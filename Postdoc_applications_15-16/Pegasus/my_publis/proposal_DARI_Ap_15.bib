abstract = {The instability of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion, observed in numerical simulations, is analyzed through known physical mechanisms and possible numerical artefacts. The mechanisms of the longitudinal and transverse instabilities, established within the accretion line model, are clarified. They cannot account for the instability of BHL accretion at moderate Mach number when the pressure forces within the shock cone are taken into account. The advective-acoustic instability is considered in the context of BHL accretion when the shock is detached from the accretor. This mechanism naturally explains the stability of the flow when the shock is weak, and the instability when the accretor is small. In particular, it is a robust proof of the instability of 3D accretion when gamma=5/3 if the accretor is small enough, even for moderate shock strength (M sim 3). The numerical artefacts that may be present in existing numerical simulations are reviewed, with particular attention paid to the advection of entropy/vorticity perturbations and the artificial acoustic feedback from the accretor boundary condition. Several numerical tests are proposed to test these mechanisms.},

This paper draws together the work performed in this area since the problem was first studied. Time has shown that, despite the simplifications made, Bondi, Hoyle and Lyttleton made quite accurate predictions for the accretion rate. Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton accretion has found application in many fields of astronomy, and these are also discussed. Published in: New Astron.Rev. 48 (2004) 843-859},

@article{Liu2006,
abstract = {We present a new edition of the catalogue of high-mass X-ray binaries in the Galaxy. The catalogue contains source name(s), coordinates, finding chart, X-ray luminosity, system parameters, and stellar parameters of the components and other characteristic properties of 114 high-mass X-ray binaries, together with a comprehensive selection of the relevant literature. The aim of this catalogue is to provide the reader with some basic information on the X-ray sources and their counterparts in other wavelength ranges ($\gamma$-rays, UV, optical, IR, radio). About 60\% of the high-mass X-ray binary candidates are known or suspected Be/X-ray binaries, while 32\% are supergiant/X-ray binaries. Some sources, however, are only tentatively identified as high-mass X-ray binaries on the basis of their X-ray properties similar to the known high-mass X-ray binaries. Further identification in other wavelength bands is needed to finally determine the nature of these sources. In cases where there is some doubt about the high-mass nature of the X-ray binary this is mentioned. Literature published before 1 October 2005 has, as far as possible, been taken into account.},

@article{Matsuda1987,
abstract = {Two-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of an accretion flow onto a compact object fed by a stellar wind in a close binary system with a mass ratio of unity are presented for the case of a stellar wind driven by thermal pressure. Large absolute values for the efficiency factor are obtained, and it is found that the accreted angular momentum can become negative, in contradiction to previous results. The sporadic changing of sign of the accreted angular momentum for flip-flop flows may explain the periodic fluctuation noted for Vela X-1. For specific heat ratios of 5/3, sound speed of the gas, c(0), values greater than 2.5 give a conical accretion shock, while a c(0) value of 1.5 gives a retrograde rotating disk bounded by a bow shock from a wind gas.},

abstract = {We prove that the sonic surface of axisymmetric meridional stationary flows is always attached to the accretor, however small, if the adiabatic index of the gas is gamma=5/3. Using local expansions near a point-like accretor, we extend Bondi's classification of spherically symmetric flows to axisymmetric flows, introducing the possibility of angular sectors reached by no flow lines, and singular directions of infinite mass flux, in addition to the angular regions of subsonic and supersonic accretion. For gamma<5/3, we show the impossibility of subsonic accretion onto a point-like accretor when the entropy of the flow is not uniform. The special case gamma=5/3 is treated separately. We analyse the influence of the adiabatic index and Mach number of the flow at infinity on the mass accretion rate of shocked spherical flows. We propose an interpolation formula for the mass accretion rate of axisymmetric flows as a function of the Mach number and the adiabatic index, in the range 9/7<gamma<5/3.},

Some uncertainties regarding the validity of this interpretation are discussed, including departures from repeatability in the light curve and from corotation, the effects of heating and reflection, and the possibility that the primary is inside the Roche lobe. Numerical calculations of light curves show that Cyg X-1 can be either a black hole or a normal early-type star with a mass not less than 9 solar masses; the mass of SMC X-1 is about 2.3 solar masses, close to the upper limit for a nonrotating neutron star; and the mass of Cen X-3 is between 0.6 and 1.1 solar masses. No significant constraints could be derived from the available data for Her X-1.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an update on the open source MPI-AMRVAC simulation toolkit where we focus on solar- and non-relativistic astrophysical magneto-fluid dynamics. We highlight recent developments in terms of physics modules such as hydrodynamics with dust coupling and the conservative implementation of Hall magnetohydrodynamics. A simple conservative high-order finite difference scheme that works in combination with all available physics modules is introduced and demonstrated at the example of monotonicity preserving fifth order reconstruction. Strong stability preserving high order Runge-Kutta time steppers are used to obtain stable evolutions in multidimensional applications realizing up to fourth order accuracy in space and time. With the new distinction between active and passive grid cells, MPI-AMRVAC is ideally suited to simulate evolutions where parts of the solution are controlled analytically, or have a tendency to progress into or out of a stationary state. Typical test problems and representative applications are discussed, with an outlook to follow-up research. Finally, we discuss the parallel scaling of the code and demonstrate excellent weak scaling up to 30 000 processors allowing to exploit modern petascale infrastructure.},

@article{Walborn2010,
abstract = {The Onfp class of rotationally broadened, hot spectra was defined some time ago in the Galaxy, where its membership to date numbers only eight. The principal defining characteristic is a broad, centrally reversed He II \$\backslash lambda\$4686 emission profile; other emission and absorption lines are also rotationally broadened. Recent surveys in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) have brought the class membership there, including some related spectra, to 28. We present a survey of the spectral morphology and rotational velocities, as a first step toward elucidating the nature of this class. Evolved, rapidly rotating hot stars are not expected theoretically, because the stellar winds should brake the rotation. Luminosity classification of these spectra is not possible, because the principal criterion (He II \$\backslash lambda\$4686) is peculiar; however, the MCs provide reliable absolute magnitudes, which show that they span the entire range from dwarfs to supergiants. The Onfp line-broadening distribution is distinct and shifted toward larger values from those of normal O dwarfs and supergiants with >99.99\% confidence. All cases with multiple observations show line-profile variations, which even remove some objects from the class temporarily. Some of them are spectroscopic binaries; it is possible that the peculiar profiles may have multiple causes among different objects. The origin and future of these stars are intriguing; for instance, they could be stellar mergers and/or gamma-ray-burst progenitors.},
