abstract = {We prove that the sonic surface of axisymmetric meridional stationary flows is always attached to the accretor, however small, if the adiabatic index of the gas is gamma=5/3. Using local expansions near a point-like accretor, we extend Bondi's classification of spherically symmetric flows to axisymmetric flows, introducing the possibility of angular sectors reached by no flow lines, and singular directions of infinite mass flux, in addition to the angular regions of subsonic and supersonic accretion. For gamma{\textless}5/3, we show the impossibility of subsonic accretion onto a point-like accretor when the entropy of the flow is not uniform. The special case gamma=5/3 is treated separately. We analyse the influence of the adiabatic index and Mach number of the flow at infinity on the mass accretion rate of shocked spherical flows. We propose an interpolation formula for the mass accretion rate of axisymmetric flows as a function of the Mach number and the adiabatic index, in the range 9/7{\textless}gamma{\textless}5/3.},

abstract = {We present the results of a search through the photometric database of Kepler eclipsing binaries looking for evidence of hierarchical triple-star systems. The presence of a third star orbiting the binary can be inferred from eclipse timing variations. We apply a simple algorithm in an automated determination of the eclipse times for all 2157 binaries. The "calculated" eclipse times, based on a constant period model, are subtracted from those observed. The resulting O - C (observed minus calculated times) curves are then visually inspected for periodicities in order to find triple-star candidates. After eliminating false positives due to the beat frequency between the {\~{}}1/2 hr Kepler cadence and the binary period, 39 candidate triple systems were identified. The periodic O - C curves for these candidates were then fit for contributions from both the classical Roemer delay and so-called physical delay, in an attempt to extract a number of the system parameters of the triple. We discuss the limitations of the information that can be inferred from these O - C curves without further supplemental input, e.g., ground-based spectroscopy. Based on the limited range of orbital periods for the triple-star systems to which this search is sensitive, we can extrapolate to estimate that at least 20{\%} of all close binaries have tertiary companions.},

abstract = {X-ray emission associated to accretion onto compact objects displays important levels of photometric and spectroscopic time-variability. When the accretor orbits a Supergiant star, it captures a fraction of the supersonic radiatively-driven wind which forms shocks in its vicinity. The amplitude and stability of this gravitational beaming of the flow conditions the mass accretion rate responsible, in fine, for the X-ray luminosity of those Supergiant X-ray Binaries. The capacity of this low angular momentum inflow to form a disc-like structure susceptible to be the stage of well-known instabilities remains at stake. Using state-of-the-art numerical setups, we characterized the structure of a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton flow onto a compact object, from the shock down to the vicinity of the accretor, typically five orders of magnitude smaller. The evolution of the mass accretion rate and of the bow shock which forms around the accretor (transverse structure, opening angle, stability, temperature profile. . . ) with the Mach num- ber of the incoming flow is described in detail. The robustness of those simulations based on the High Performance Computing MPI-AMRVAC code is supported by the topology of the inner sonic surface, in agreement with theoretical expectations. We developed a synthetic model of mass transfer in Supergiant X-ray Binaries which couples the launch- ing of the wind accordingly to the stellar parameters, the orbital evolution of the streamlines in a modified Roche potential and the accretion process. We show that the shape of the permanent flow is entirely de- termined by the mass ratio, the filling factor, the Eddington factor and the alpha force multiplier. Provided scales such as the orbital period are known, we can trace back the observables to evaluate the mass accre- tion rates, the accretion mechanism (stream or wind-dominated) and the shearing of the inflow, tracer of its capacity to form a disc around the accretor.},

abstract = {Bondi-Hoyle accretion configurations occur as soon as a gravitating body is immersed in an ambient medium with a supersonic relative velocity. From wind-accreting X-ray binaries to runaway neutron stars, such a regime has been witnessed many times and is believed to account for shock formation, the properties of which can be only marginally derived analytically. In this paper, we present the first results of the numerical characterization of the stationary flow structure of Bondi-Hoyle accretion on to a compact object, from the large-scale accretion radius down to the vicinity of the compact body. For different Mach numbers, we study the associated bow shock. It turns out that those simulations confirm the analytical prediction by Foglizzo {\&} Ruffert concerning the topology of the inner sonic surface with an adiabatic index of 5/3. They also enable us to derive the related mass accretion rates, the position and the temperature of the bow shock, as function of the flow parameters, along with the transverse density and temperature profiles in the wake.},

abstract = {We report here on the discovery of stellar occultations, observed with Kepler, that recur periodically at 15.685 hour intervals, but which vary in depth from a maximum of 1.2{\%} to a minimum that can be less than 0.2{\%}. The star that is apparently being occulted is KIC 12557548, a V = 16 magnitude K dwarf with Teff,s ? 4400 K. The out-of-occultation behavior shows no evidence for ellipsoidal light variations, indicating that the mass of the orbiting object is less than ∼3MJ. Because the eclipse depths are highly variable, they cannot be due solely to transits of a single planet with a fixed size. We discuss but dismiss a scenario involving a binary giant planet whose mutual orbit plane precesses, bringing one of the planets into and out of a grazing transit. This scenario seems ruled out by the dynamical instability that would result from such a configuration. The much more likely explanation involves macroscopic particles—e.g., dust, possibly in the form of micron-sized pyroxene grains— escaping the atmosphere of a slowly disintegrating planet not much larger than Mercury in size. The planetary surface is hot enough to sublimate; the resultant silicate vapor accelerates off the planet via a Parker-type thermal wind, dragging dust grains with it. We infer a mass loss rate from the observations of order 1 M⊕/Gyr, with a dust-to-gas ratio possibly of order unity. For our fiducial 0.1M⊕ planet (twice the mass of Mercury), the evaporation timescale may be ∼0.2 Gyr. Smaller mass planets are disfavored because they evaporate still more quickly, as are larger mass planets because they have surface gravities too strong to sustain outflows with the requisite mass-loss rates. The occultation profile evinces an ingress-egress asymmetry that could reflect a comet-like dust tail trailing the planet; we present simulations of such a tail. Subject},

The stellar wind from the massive companion is believed to be the main source of matter accreted by the compact object. With this first paper, we introduce a ballistic model to characterize the structure of the wind at the orbital scale as it accelerates, from the stellar surface to the vicinity of the accretor. Thanks to the parametrization we retained and the numerical pipeline we designed, we can investigate the supersonic flow and the subsequent observables as a function of a reduced set of characteristic numbers and scales. We show that the shape of the permanent flow is entirely determined by the mass ratio, the filling factor, the Eddington factor and the {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-force multiplier which drives the stellar wind acceleration. Provided scales such as the orbital period are known, we can trace back the observables to evaluate the mass accretion rates, the accretion mechanism, the shearing of the inflow and the stellar parameters. We confront our model to three persistent Supergiant X-ray Binaries (Vela X-1, IGR J18027-2016, XTE J1855-026) and discuss the likelihood of wind-formed accretion discs around the accretors in each case, further investigated in a following paper.},

abstract = {We present the results of a survey aimed at discovering and studying transiting planets with orbital periods shorter than one day (ultra--short-period, or USP, planets), using data from the {\{}$\backslash$em Kepler{\}} spacecraft. We computed Fourier transforms of the photometric time series for all 200,000 target stars, and detected transit signals based on the presence of regularly spaced sharp peaks in the Fourier spectrum. We present a list of 106 USP candidates, of which 18 have not previously been described in the literature. In addition, among the objects we studied, there are 26 USP candidates that had been previously reported in the literature which do not pass our various tests. All 106 of our candidates have passed several standard tests to rule out false positives due to eclipsing stellar systems. A low false positive rate is also implied by the relatively high fraction of candidates for which more than one transiting planet signal was detected. By assuming these multi-transit candidates represent coplanar multi-planet systems, we are able to infer that the USP planets are typically accompanied by other planets with periods in the range 1-50 days, in contrast with hot Jupiters which very rarely have companions in that same period range. Another clear pattern is that almost all USP planets are smaller than 2 {\$}R{\_}\backslashoplus{\$}, possibly because gas giants in very tight orbits would lose their atmospheres by photoevaporation when subject to extremely strong stellar irradiation. Based on our survey statistics, USP planets exist around approximately {\$}(0.51\backslashpm 0.07)\backslash{\%}{\$} of G-dwarf stars, and {\$}(0.83\backslashpm 0.18)\backslash{\%}{\$} of K-dwarf stars.},
